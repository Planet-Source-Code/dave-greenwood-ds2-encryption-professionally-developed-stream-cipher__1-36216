### Description

DS2 is a professionally developed symmetric stream cipher encryption algorithm.  It supports undeterminably large variable-length keys using two sboxes and was specifically designed for the Visual Basic environment but due to its success the DS2 is being ported to all platforms/languages. Provided in an Easy to use Class Module.

Many Thanks to David Midkiff for his contributions & support to the project.
